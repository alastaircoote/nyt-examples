                So what is jQuery? The short answer is that it's a collection of
                utilities to make it easier to work with JavaScript. Once it's loaded,
                it is available by using the $ character in your script. It has a ton
                of documentation:

                http://api.jquery.com/

                Let's use it to power a search script.

                First, let's write the function that will fetch our search results.

                One of the most common uses of jQuery is as an element selector. We
                select elements by using CSS selectors. If you don't know them, we only
                need one to begin with:

                $("#txtSearchFor")

                A selector starting with # looks for an element by its ID. Each ID
                should be used once per page. So, let's use jQuery's "on" function to
                register what's called an event handler - some code we want to run when
                the search button is clicked.
            */

            $("#btnSearch").on("click", function() {

                // So, we've hooked onto the 'click' event, and the code within this function
                // will run when the button is clicked.

                // Let's grab the text typed into the search box and assign it to a variable:

                var searchText = $("#txtSearchFor").val();

                // What if the textbox is empty? Let's check for that and show an error
                // if it is.

                if (searchText == "") {
                    
                    alert("You didn't enter any text in the search box!");
                
                } else {

                    /*  We're going to use the Times Article Search API. Documentation is available
                        here:
